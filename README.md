The real-world projects I have completed and posted here in this repository demonstrates my abilities best.    In addition, included is a collaborative group project example, demonstrating the entire Data Analytics process including launching a cloud based interactive Machine Learning Predictor and geo-json  Leaflet application web page.

I have had the pleasure of participating on many multi-million dollar Real Estate investments Project Teams.  Completed a variety of New Construction, Design, & Operations projects for various Private, Public, and Government Owners.
