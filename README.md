###  Hi there!   
Thank you for visiting my GitHub page.   
###  A little about me...
  - A Data Analyst with a background in Business Management,  Information Systems & Technology, Computer Aided Design, & Architecture.  
  - I am passionate about transforming data into stories and useful tools for people including employees, customers, and stakeholders.   
  - I am a recent graduate of University of Denver, Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp where I gained the technical programming and analytical skills.  The real-world projects I finished and posted in my GitHub repository demonstrates my abilities best.  In addition, I have a collaborative group project example demonstrating the entire Data Analytics processing including launching a cloud based interactive Leaflet application and Machine Learning Predictor. 

  - I am a people person and I most like to spend time working in groups collaborating and producing great work.    I most enjoy time with my loved ones in nature.   I love to hike, camp and garden.   I especially love to cook what we grow in the garden.
