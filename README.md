###  Hi there!   
Thank you for visiting my GitHub page.   
###  A little about me...
  - A Data Analyst with a background in Business Management,  Information Systems & Technology, Computer Aided Design, & Architecture.  
  - I am passionate about transforming data into stories and useful tools for people including employees, customers, and stakeholders.   
  - I am a recent graduate of University of Denver, Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp where I gained the technical programming and analytical skills.  The real-world projects I finished and posted here in this repository demonstrates my abilities best.  In addition, I have a collaborative group project example demonstrating the entire Data Analytics processing including launching a cloud based interactive Leaflet application and Machine Learning Predictor. 
  - I also have a Business graduate degree from University of Denver which prepared me to manage types of teams, and participate on many large scale, very high profile Construction & Design projects for various Private, Public, and Government Owners.         
  - I continue to develop my Data Analytics skills through my current building drawing work, online classes and personal projects so I can explore the amazing field of Data Analytics further.
