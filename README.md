###  A little about me...
  - A Data Analyst with a background in Business Management,  Information Systems & Technology (CAFM), Computer Aided Design & Drafting (CADD) & Building Architecture & LEED Green Building Construction Management.  
  - I am passionate about transforming data into stories, informative visuals, and useful tools for all stakeholders.   
  - I am a recent graduate of University of Denver, Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp where I gained additional technical programming and analytical skills.  The real-world projects I have completed and posted here in this repository demonstrates my abilities best.    In addition, included is a collaborative group project example demonstrating the entire Data Analytics process including launching a cloud based interactive Leaflet application and Machine Learning Predictor. 
  - I also earned my M.S.S. Business Graduate degree from University of Denver, & my B.S. from Regis University, which prepared me to successfully manage many types of teams, and participate on many multi-million dollar Real Estate investments in New Construction, Design, and Operations projects for various Private, Public, and Government Owners.
