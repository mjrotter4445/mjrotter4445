###  Hi there!   
Thank you for visiting my GitHub page.   
###  A little about me...
  - A Data Analyst with a background in Business Management,  Information Systems & Technology (CAFM), Computer Aided Design & Drafting (CADD) & Building Architecture & Construction Management.  
  - I am passionate about transforming data into stories, visuals and useful tools for people including employees, customers, and stakeholders.   
  - I am a recent graduate of University of Denver, Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp where I gained the technical programming and analytical skills.  The real-world projects I have completed and posted here in this repository demonstrates my abilities best.    In addition, I have a collaborative group project example demonstrating the entire Data Analytics processing including launching a cloud based interactive Leaflet application and Machine Learning Predictor. 
  - I also earned my Business Graduate degree from University of Denver which prepared me to manage many types of teams, and participate on many multi-million dollar Real Estate investments in New Construction, Design, and Operations projects for various Private, Public, and Government Owners.         
  - I continue to develop my Data Analytics skills through my current building drawing work, online classes and personal projects so I can explore the amazing field of Data Analytics further.
